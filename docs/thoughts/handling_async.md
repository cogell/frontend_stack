Dealing with async funcs in Javascript:
- if you are dealing with one async function you can get by with just using a callback
- if you are dealing with multiple async funcs you can use promises
- if you want to sequence async funcs you want some event emitters
- if you want data flow to be streams of async events+payloads its fucking reactive time
